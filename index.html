  <h1>That Damn BBS</h1>
  <p class="blink">_</p>

  <h2>Who the Hell Are We?</h2>
  <p>Old-school. Gen X. Veteran trucker. Grew up when dial-up was king and Wildcat was gospel. That Damn BBS is my way of bringing that world back—raw, unpolished, and real.</p>

  <h2>What Is This?</h2>
  <p>This isn't a blog. It’s not a podcast. It’s a digital BBS reboot for the modern era—hosted on GitHub, powered by grit, fueled by late nights and diesel fumes.</p>
  <p>We’re building a community space for truckers, technicians, coders, misfits, preppers, and anyone else who knows the value of doing things the hard way—because it’s the right way.</p>

  <h2>Where’s It Going?</h2>
  <p>Eventually: full BBS-style features. Self-hosted tools. Internal file shares. Secure vault access. Integrated AI for roadside diagnostics, payroll audits, trip logging, and even community message boards.</p>
  <p>Right now? We’re barely past the "hello world" stage. But it’s real. And it’s growing.</p>

  <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
  <p>Because everything today feels plastic. Sanitized. Disposable. This ain’t that. This is a call back to what tech used to be—personal, weird, rebellious, useful.</p>
  <p>I need help. My Step-son Tyler is struggling. His friend Billy is AWOL.  I’m juggling a dozen differnt projects and Trucking OTR. But this matters. And if you’ve ever heard the sound of a 56k modem and felt that itch in your soul… maybe it matters to you, too.</p>

  <h2>Want In?</h2>
  <p>If you’ve got time, talent, or just want to see this thing live and breathe, fork the repo or drop me a message. I’ll take coders, designers, testers, logistics freaks, or anyone who can keep their word and bring some fire.</p>
