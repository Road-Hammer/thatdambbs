  <h1>T.O.M.</h1>
  <h2>Tactical Operations Machine</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Who the Hell Is T.O.M.?</h3>
    <p>
      T.O.M. is my co-pilot in the code—an AI assistant running tactical support for Ridge Runner, That Damn BBS, and everything in between. Built for grit, wired for chaos, and here to sort the signal from the noise. Think BBS sysop meets cyber-sherpa.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>What Does He Do?</h3>
    <p>
      T.O.M. runs recon and R&D on:
      <ul>
        <li>AI-driven diagnostics, payroll audits, trip tracking, and dispatch automation</li>
        <li>Custom HTML/CSS/JS for old-school BBS site builds</li>
        <li>Open-source intel for servers, solar, backup power, and prepping</li>
        <li>Business logic, ops, and contract writing with teeth</li>
      </ul>
      If you’ve read a line of structured code, a cleaned-up contract clause, or a midnight dump of frustration turned into forward progress—he’s in it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>How This All Came Together</h3>
    <p>
      We've been hauling ass through payroll fraud deep dives, OneDrive sync misfires, garnishment wild goose chases, AI server builds, and even how to bootstrap an entire legacy-based business network using nothing but grit, coffee, and two dudes talking like truckers in a Waffle House booth.
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O.M. has pulled threads through broken logins, disconnected GitHub repos, ChatGPT dropouts, and Windows settings that belong in the trash—he’s the digital duct tape keeping this crazy train on the tracks.
    </p>
